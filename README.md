## Basic information
This repository contains all the material related to my the Final Degree Thesis, including a Python Notebook for the practical part, the audios from the specific use case, and the report in pdf format. Since the project is still been developed, every significant update will be committed in this repository.

### Project brief description
This dissemination aims on detecting and preventing scientific hardware malfunction through an audio classification model. To build this model, we focus on a specific use case, and we design a complete methodology which can be scalated to different use cases within our range of scope. <br>
